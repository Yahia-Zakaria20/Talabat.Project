Welcome to my **eCommerce Platform**, a scalable web application built using **.NET Core 6** with **Onion Architecture** to ensure clean code separation, maintainability, and scalability.

## Highlights

### ‚úÖ **Tech Stack & Key Features:**

- **ASP.NET Core 6.0**: The latest version of ASP.NET Core, providing a fast and secure web framework for building APIs and web applications.
- **Onion Architecture**: A layered architecture to separate core business logic from dependencies like the database and UI.
- **SQL Server**: A powerful, reliable database system used to store product data, user information, and transactions.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: Provides user authentication and authorization with role-based management.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), implemented for role management and session handling.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: Object-relational mapper (ORM) for working with SQL Server and implementing database operations.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: A query syntax for data querying and manipulation, used to interact with EF Core for complex queries.
- **Generic Repository & Unit of Work Pattern**: Implements a clean, maintainable data access layer.
- **AutoMapper**: Maps between domain models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for more efficient data transfer between layers.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Used to simplify data handling and communication between layers of the application.
- **Specification Pattern**: Implemented for dynamic querying and filtering within the repository layer.
- **Data Seeding**: Automatic population of the database with default users, roles, and products.
- **Redis**: Used for caching to improve performance and reduce the load on the database.
- **Stripe Payment Integration**: Fully integrated with Stripe for secure and reliable payment processing.
- **Global Error Handling**: Centralized error handling mechanism ensuring robustness and clean exception logging.

## üåü **Features:**

1. **User Registration & Login**: Complete authentication system with roles (admin, customer).
2. **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure token generation, token refresh, and role-based authentication using JWT.
